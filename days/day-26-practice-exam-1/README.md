## Key Concepts to Remember

Quick reference for common exam topics:

### Data Movement
- **Snowpipe**: Auto-ingest from cloud storage, uses serverless compute
- **Streams**: CDC with METADATA$ACTION, METADATA$ISUPDATE, METADATA$ROW_ID
- **Tasks**: CRON scheduling, DAGs, SYSTEM$STREAM_HAS_DATA()
- **External Tables**: Read-only, query data in cloud storage

### Performance
- **Clustering**: Best for high-cardinality columns, check clustering_depth
- **Materialized Views**: Auto-maintained, cost vs. performance trade-off
- **Warehouse Sizing**: T-shirt sizes (XS to 6XL), multi-cluster for concurrency
- **Result Cache**: 24-hour TTL, exact query match required

### Security
- **RBAC**: Role hierarchy, future grants, OWNERSHIP vs. USAGE
- **Masking**: Column-level, role-based visibility
- **Row Access**: Row-level filtering, policy per table
- **Time Travel**: 0-90 days (Enterprise), Fail-safe 7 days (non-recoverable)

### Monitoring
- **ACCOUNT_USAGE**: 45-min to 3-hour latency, 365-day retention
- **INFORMATION_SCHEMA**: Real-time, limited retention
- **Query Profile**: Identify bottlenecks, partition pruning, spilling

### Advanced
- **Stored Procedures**: JavaScript/SQL/Python, EXECUTE AS CALLER/OWNER
- **UDFs**: Scalar vs. Table (UDTF), MEMOIZABLE for caching
- **Snowpark**: DataFrame API, lazy evaluation, pushdown optimization
